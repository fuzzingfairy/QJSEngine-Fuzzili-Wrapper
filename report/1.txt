CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion

Due to a lack of input validation, an attacker can trigger a Stack Overflow due to the uncontrolled recursion between `QV4::RuntimeHelpers::ordinaryToPrimitive()` and `QV4::RuntimeHelpers::objectDefaultValue()` that can lead to a Denial of Service by evaluating javascript which contains an object that references itself through one of its properties

* Expected behavior 
Application should handle the dereferencing of self-referencing object by notifying the user of an error without crashing.

* Actual behavior
Application crashes due to a lack of available stack space


Security Impact
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Availability of the process utilizing QML could be disrupted


Remediation and Mitigating Factors
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remediation can be acheived by passing a depth parameter between the vulnerable functions and dissallowing recursion past a certain depth

Affected Components
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
file: qtdeclarative/src/qml/jsruntime/qv4runtime.cpp
functions: 
	- RuntimeHelpers:objectDefaultValue
	- RuntimeHelpers::ordinaryToPrimitive

* Proof of Concept Code
let v1 [1, 1, 1];
v1[1] = v1;
const v2 = v1--;
